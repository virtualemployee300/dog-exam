# Dog Exam

- Please clone this repository 
- Install the packages and get the site working locally. Ideally with `yarn` but can use `npm`
- To get the project to run please run `yarn dev` or `npm dev`
- Which runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

-	The goal of this task is to reproduce the image below using the Dog API.
  -	You can read about the API here: https://dog.ceo/dog-api/
  -	I would recommend only using this endpoint: https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random

-	Inside the repo you will just find a basic version of create-react-app with some minor edits and all the available packages should already exist.

-	Please feel free to ask any questions.

-	Bonus Points: if you can reverse the words in the dog name so e.g “Scottish Terrier” instead of “Terrier Scottish”
